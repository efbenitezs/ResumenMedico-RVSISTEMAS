I, [NombrePaciente], declare that the information that I have provided in terms of my medical history and during my immigration health examinations as recorded in the eMedical system is true, complete and correct.

I understand that:

• my personal details and health information are being collected in the eMedical system to enable Immigration New Zealand ("INZ"), Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment ("MBIE") to determine whether or not they are satisfied that I meet the health criteria for a New Zealand visa(s);

• INZ is authorised to collect and use the personal information entered into the eMedical system under the Immigration Act 2009, regulations made under that Act and in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993; further information about the purposes for which INZ requires my information is included in my visa application form which can be found on the INZ website at www.immigration.govt.nz <http://www.immigration.govt.nz>;

• as required health examinations must be completed and assessed prior to a visa decision being made, if the information I have provided is not stored within the eMedical system, the processing of my visa application will be delayed, and my visa application may not be accepted if I fail to complete the required health examinations;

• if I have provided any false or misleading information as part of my immigration health examination, my visa application(s) may be declined and I may become liable for deportation. I may also be committing an offence and I may be imprisoned;

• I must inform INZ of any relevant fact or any change of circumstance that may affect the decision on my application for a visa due to my health circumstances;

• the information collected and stored relating to my New Zealand immigration medical examination will be electronically processed by the panel clinic I have selected in the eMedical system;

• the eMedical system is an electronic system hosted, operated and maintained by the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection ("DIBP");

• the information collected related to my immigration medical examination will be temporarily stored in the eMedical system and electronically transferred to INZ;

• DIBP will keep confidential any information stored temporarily within eMedical in relation to my immigration medical examination and is only authorised by INZ to use or disclose the information for the following purposes: where DIBP is required by law to do so, or for technical purposes related to the operation and maintenance of the eMedical system;

• the Government of New Zealand becomes the owner of the information entered about me into the eMedical system;

• further information about the eMedical system is also available on the DIBP website at: <http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/health-> requirements/electronic-health-processing.htm;

• if I confirm at the pre-exam stage of my health examination that I want to receive confirmation by email that my health examination has been completed:

• this confirmation will be emailed to the email address I have provided for this purpose; and

• if I later decide to use a different email address to the one I provided for this purpose, it is my responsibility to inform the panel clinic; and

• if I provide the email address of an immigration adviser for this purpose, I am consenting to the release of information about my health examination to them; and

• if I provide the email address of an immigration adviser I will complete the INZ form Immigration Adviser Details (INZ 1160) and give it to the panel clinic to attach to my health examination, otherwise I will provide it directly to INZ as soon as I am able;

• if I want to access my personal information held in the eMedical system I will be able to request a copy of, and correction to my personal information:

• from the panel clinic that examined me, once I have been notified by the clinic that my health examination has been completed; and

• from INZ once the panel clinic has transferred my completed health examination to INZ. The INZ website at www.immigration.govt.nz <http://www.immigration.govt.nz> contains INZ's contact information;

• that INZ will retain my personal information for use in assessing my health in the future as necessary, or for audit reasons.

I also understand that my personal information (including my sensitive information) stored in the eMedical system (including medical results, bio details and digital photographs) may be disclosed to:

• New Zealand Government health agencies, health and settlement service providers and examining physician(s);

• New Zealand Government agencies entitled to receive this information by law, to the extent necessary to make decisions about my immigration status; and

• New Zealand law enforcement, health agencies and international agencies, including overseas recipients in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and Australia. [Note: if I am applying for a visa as a refugee or protected person, INZ will only disclose this information to another country, if it is satisfied that this information will not be disclosed to the country from which I have sought refugee or protection status and the disclosure is otherwise permitted under the Immigration Act 2009].

I consent to:

• my medical information being submitted to INZ for the purposes of assessing my health for current or future New Zealand visa applications;

• my medical information being temporarily stored on the eMedical system owned and operated by DIBP; 

• INZ retaining my medical information, including any x-ray images uploaded to the eMedical system, beyond the determination of my visa application, for the purposes of considering future applications I may make for a visa to New Zealand;

• INZ storing my digital photograph(s) which may be used by INZ for client identification purposes in addition to the health examination process;

• INZ disclosing my personal information, including information about my health, to the radiologists or panel physicians who have examined me. The reason(s) for this disclosure will be to investigate inconsistencies between the radiologist and/or panel physician's examination and a previous/subsequent health assessment, to investigate a complaint against the radiologist or panel physician, or to follow up adverse results with the radiologist or panel physician to ensure the quality of the work undertaken by New Zealand's panel physician network;

I undertake to pay the fees for this medical examination including laboratory tests and I also agree that I or my child will undergo, at my expense, any further medical examination(s) that may be required by INZ in respect of the immigration application.
